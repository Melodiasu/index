                explanation: "Rearrangement tasks assess a learner's ability to organize language elements logically and grammatically, testing syntax, cohesion, and discourse structure. However, they do not require learners to generate original content, so the ability to express original ideas is not assessed. (Hughes, p.81)"

                correct: "D",
                explanation: "Short answer questions require test-takers to produce responses, reducing the chance of guessing correctly compared to multiple-choice questions, where guessing can contribute more to scores. (Hughes, p.79)"

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Yes/No and True/False items have a 50% chance of correct guessing, which reduces their reliability as an assessment tool. (Hughes, p.79)"

                correct: "D",

                question: "What is a key difference between multiple choice and short answer questions?",
                options: ["A) Multiple choice questions focus more on listening and speaking skills, while short answer questions focus more on reading and writing skills.", "B) Short answer questions require students to write a brief and original response, while multiple choice questions provide answer options to choose from.", "C) Multiple choice questions almost always include pictures, while short answer questions do not.", "D) Short answer questions are more objective than multiple choice questions."],
                correct: "B",

                options: ["A) They are useful for quickly assessing basic understanding of facts or concepts.", "B) True/false questions are often used to test knowledge of definitions, facts, or simple logic.", "C) True/false questions are usually avoided in formal tests where accuracy is critical.", "D) True/false questions are more reliable than multiple choice questions as they have fewer options to choose from."],
                correct: "D",
                explanation: "True/false questions are less reliable than multiple choice questions due to a 50% chance of guessing correctly, compared to a 20-25% chance with 4-5 option multiple choice questions. (Hughes, p.79)"

                options: ["A) It allows for subjective interpretation and encourages creativity in student responses.", "B) It enables open-ended answers and is ideal for assessing speaking skills.", "C) It provides a fixed set of options, which allows for objective scoring and high reliability.", "D) It measures writing fluency by requiring learners to complete unfinished sentences freely."],
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Multiple-choice items are widely used due to their objective scoring and high reliability, reducing examiner bias and ensuring consistency. (Hughes, p.76)"

                question: "Why is it recommended that a multiple choice item include at least four answer options?",
                options: ["A) To extend the overall length of the text.", "B) To increase the difficulty by confusing test takers.", "C) To require more time for test item construction.", "D) To minimize the likelihood of correct answers resulting from random guessing."],
                correct: "D",

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Requiring test-takers to produce language can be a disadvantage, as it may be challenging for lower-level learners and complicate scoring. (Hughes, p.79)"

It ______ be the doctor.", "D) I think he ______ resign.", "E) He needs to ______ up if he wants to pass his next exam."],
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Effective gap-filling items should have one clear correct answer. Item B allows multiple grammatical options (e.g., 'were watching', 'watched'), creating ambiguity and reducing reliability. (Hughes, pp.80-81)"
